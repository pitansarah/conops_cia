        <em>This table aligns the core missions of the CIA with proposed psychological and behavioral intelligence initiatives. It illustrates how traditional intelligence functions—such as foreign intelligence collection, covert operations, and strategic analysis—can be enhanced through the integration of psychological operations (PSYOPs), cognitive research, and behavioral analysis to address emerging threats and influence strategies.</em>
